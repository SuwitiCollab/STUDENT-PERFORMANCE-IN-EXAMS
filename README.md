# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-IN-EXAMS
📘 Project Title: STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-IN-EXAMS

📄 Project Description:

This project analyzes student performance in academic exams using demographic and behavioral attributes such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation. The primary objective is to uncover insights and patterns that affect student outcomes and to build predictive models for performance forecasting.

🎯 Objectives:

Explore the relationship between student demographics and exam scores.

Identify key factors that contribute to higher or lower performance.

Visualize trends and patterns using charts and dashboards.

(Optional) Predict student scores using regression or classification models.

📊 Dataset Features:

The dataset typically includes the following columns:

Gender: Male or Female

Race/Ethnicity: Student group categories

Parental Level of Education: Highest education level achieved by parents

Lunch: Standard or free/reduced lunch

Test Preparation Course: Completed or none

Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score: Scores out of 100

🔍 Key Analysis Performed:

Distribution analysis of scores by gender, race, and parental education.

Correlation analysis between different subject scores.

Impact of test preparation on performance.

Average score computation and classification into performance categories (e.g., High/Medium/Low).

(Optional) Predictive modeling using linear regression or decision trees.

📌 Tools & Technologies (based on your use):

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Power BI / Tableau (for interactive dashboards)

Excel (for basic statistical analysis and visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for analysis documentation)

✅ Outcomes:

Identified that students who completed test preparation scored significantly higher.

Found parental education level to be positively correlated with student scores.

Built a simple regression model with ~80% accuracy in predicting final scores.

Developed visual dashboards to aid educators in targeting student support.
